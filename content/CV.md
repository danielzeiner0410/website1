Hi, I am Daniel from Austria. I have studied my undergrad in Vienna & recently started with my masters degree in London at LBS. Regarding my professional experience I was able to gain insights both in Consulting and Investment banking and seek for a career in Finance in the long-term. 

In my free time I love to climb mountains, play volleyball, tennis or golf with friends, and of course to join social gatherings such as parties & game nights.
