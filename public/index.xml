      <description>Hi, I am Daniel from Austria. I have studied my undergrad in Vienna &amp;amp; recently started with my masters degree in London at LBS. Regarding my professional experience I was able to gain insights both in Consulting and Investment banking and seek for a career in Finance in the long-term.
In my free time I love to climb mountains, play volleyball, tennis or golf with friends, and of course to join social gatherings such as parties &amp;amp; game nights.</description>

      <description>I’m an Financial Analysis (MFA) student at London Business School (2021).
I have done my undergrad at the Vienna University of Business and Economics and due to my passion to mathematics, I also completed nearly half of the studies in Financial Mathematics besides my Business degree. I always was really keen to learn as much new things as possible &amp;amp; therefore constantly try to widen my horizon. LBS perfectly supports me with this objective, providing an environment with students from all over the world and first class lecturers.</description>
