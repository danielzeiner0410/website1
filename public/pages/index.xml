      <description>I’m an Financial Analysis (MFA) student at London Business School (2021).
I have done my undergrad at the Vienna University of Business and Economics and due to my passion to mathematics, I also completed nearly half of the studies in Financial Mathematics besides my Business degree. I always was really keen to learn as much new things as possible &amp;amp; therefore constantly try to widen my horizon. LBS perfectly supports me with this objective, providing an environment with students from all over the world and first class lecturers.</description>
